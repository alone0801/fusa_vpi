# AutoSoC
# BareMetal SW - Drivers
########################################################

This folder contains all Drivers available for AutoSoC. New drivers should be added
as intructed below.

The available Makefile builds all drivers into a static library to be linked 
against user applications. 

Makefile will automatically search all folders for '.c' files and folders named 'include'.
All '.c' files will be compiled and linked as a static library called libdrivers.a
The '.h' files inside of all 'include' folders, will be copied to libdrivers/include/

###############################
Add New Drivers:
###############################
To add a new-driver, just add a folder in 'Software/Baremetal/bsp/drivers/new-driver'
The header files required for driver usage should be added to 'new-driver/include'.
The other source files can have any organization inside the folder 'new-driver'.

###############################
Usage Intructions:
###############################
make all:   Build all available drivers as 'libdrivers/libdrivers.a'. 
            Add all driver headers to 'libdrivers/include/'

make clean: Delete libdrivers/*
            Delete *.o files from all drivers folders.

To build your applications using the drivers add the following to your compilation instructions:
'-L./drivers/libdrivers'        :Location for searching static library.
'-ldrivers'                     :libdrivers.a static library.
'-Idrivers/libdrivers/include'  :Location of Header Files to be included in the application.
