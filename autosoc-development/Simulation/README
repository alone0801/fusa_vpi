########################################################

This folder contains the environment for Simulation of the AutoSoC. A Makefile is included to automate the
simulation and fault injection with Xcelium XFS tool.

###############################
Basic Usage
###############################
First, environment variables should be configured by typing the command:
> source tools/set_env_variables[.csh|.sh]

After, Makefile can be executed. For example to elaborate design and run simulation (without faults injection), type the command:
> make sim

For more information on the Makefile, type the command:
> make help

###############################
Makefile Options
###############################

The Makefile can be executed with the following options:
(${SIM_FOLDER} value should be configured in ./tools/set_env_variable file. Default is 'basicSafeConfig')

'make elab':        Elaboration of design according with setup files inside of ${SIM_FOLDER}
'make sim':         Regular simulation. Testbenche configuration parameters should be set in $(SIM_FOLDER}/xrunPlusArgs.f
'make debug':       Start simulation environment with GUI. For Waveform debug.
'make good_sim':    Good simulation for Fault Injection. Strobes should be configured in file $(SIM_FOLDER}/strobes.list
'make fault_sim':   Fault Injection simulation. Fault Injection campaign is controlled by script tools/fault_inj_control.csh 
'make clean':       Delete build directory


###############################
Configuring the Simulation
###############################
The folders inside 'Simulation' should contain the setup files for simulating the AutoSoC.
New AutoSoC configurations can be added by creating a new folder and including the setup required files. 
The included folder 'basicSafeConfig' can be used as an example.

Each AutoSoC configuraton folder should contain the following files:
'xrunElab.f'        : Files to be considered for the Elaboration of the design and specific configurations for the Xcelium.
'xrunPlusArgs.f'    : Configurations for the AutoSoC Testbench. The available options are:
                        "+elf_load=<ELF image>" - ELF file to be load to memory for Simulation.
                        "+clean_ram"            - Clear all content of RAM on start of Simulation.
                        "+jtag_vpi_enable"      - Enable connection of JTAG Debug tool (OpenOCD).
                        "+enable_jtag_vpi"      - Should be used together with +jtag_vpi_enable.
                        "+enable_jtag_vpi"      - Should be used together with +jtag_vpi_enable.

                        Safety Mechanisms Configuration (Hardware):
                        "+define+LOCKSTEP"      - Enable Lockstep SM (Redundancy of Main CPU with time diversity).
                        "+define+PARITY"        - Enable BUS Parity (Parity check on data exchanges CPU <-> Memory).
                        "+define+MEMECC"        - Enable ECC  correction on main Memory

                        Safety Mechanisms Configuration (Hardware/Software):
                        "+define+CHECKPOINT"    - Enable SW Control Flow Verification (Monitor bus for signatures from the SW tasks).
                                                - Checkpoint requires a compatible SW application. It expects a periodic signature in 
                                                - a specific memory address (Signatures, Memory Address and Timeouts are configurable).
                                                - It is compatible with the application '$SW_DIR/RTEMS/sample_apps/autosoc.exe'.

'faultTarget.spec'  : Design Fault Target, for Fault Injection Campaigns. Define Instance of design that should be considered as fault target.
'strobes.list'      : Strobes for Fault Analysis. Signals of the design that are going to identify fault propagation and detection.

For more information on simulation options, configuration of Faults and Strobes refer to XFS User Manual.

###############################
Add New AutoSoC Configurations
###############################
To add new configurations of the AutoSoC to be simulated, copy the folder 'basicSafeConfig' to <new_config>.
> cp -r basicSafeConfig <new_config>

Edit the configuration files inside <new_config> according with the desired configuration (correct HARDWARE files to be considered during elaboration, fault targets, strobe definitions, ...)

Edit the variable SIM_FOLDER inside the file 'tools/set_env_variables.csh' to point to the created folder <new_config>:
setenv SIM_FOLDER <new_config>
